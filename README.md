# Note Taker

## Description

An app that allows users to create notes and store them to the server for viewing later. App does not currently allow for editing or deleting. Future updates/improvements would add the previously mentioned usability.

## Installation

To create this app I needed to run "npm i" and then used "npm uuid" (to create unique IDs for each note).
